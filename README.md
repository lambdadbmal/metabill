# metabill

<!-- [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/xcoo/clj-build-date.svg)](https://clojars.org/xcoo/clj-build-date) -->

A minimal library to read build info.

## Prepare

Put `[jp.xcoo/metabill "0.1.0"]` into the `:dependencies` vector and `[jp.xcoo/lein-metabill "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.
And run `lein metabill` before building system:

```
$ lein metabill
output metabill.edn
```

You get `metabill.edn`.

## Usage

(defn frame
  [req]
  (html5
   [:head
    [:title "Hello World!"]
    [:meta {:charset "utf-8"}]
    (include-css (with-build-date "/css/main.css"))]
   [:body
    [:div#app]
    (include-js (with-build-date "/js/main.js"))]))
